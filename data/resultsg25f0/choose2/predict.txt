The correct output is A.

The rule is to extend each '8' in the input grid either horizontally to the right until it hits another '8' or the grid boundary, or vertically downwards until it hits another '8' or the grid boundary. If an '8' has another '8' to its right and another '8' below it, it extends both horizontally and vertically.

Let's analyze the final input:
Input:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

Let's trace the '8's:

1.  **Input[1,1] = 8**:
    *   Extends vertically downwards. It hits Input[5,1]=8. So, cells (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) become 8.
    *   No '8' to its right in the same row.

2.  **Input[2,3] = 8**:
    *   Extends vertically downwards. It hits Input[8,3] (which is 0, but there's an 8 at Input[8,4]). It extends until the boundary or another 8. It extends to the boundary. So, cells (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3) become 8.
    *   No '8' to its right in the same row.

3.  **Input[3,7] = 8**:
    *   Extends vertically downwards. It hits Input[8,7]=8. So, cells (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7) become 8.
    *   No '8' to its right in the same row.

4.  **Input[5,1] = 8**:
    *   Extends vertically downwards. It hits Input[8,1] (which is 0). It extends to the boundary. So, cells (6,1), (7,1), (8,1) become 8.
    *   No '8' to its right in the same row.

5.  **Input[8,4] = 8**:
    *   Extends vertically downwards. It hits the boundary. No cells below.
    *   Extends horizontally to the right. It hits Input[8,7]=8. So, cells (8,5), (8,6) become 8.

6.  **Input[8,7] = 8**:
    *   Extends vertically downwards. It hits the boundary. No cells below.
    *   No '8' to its right in the same row.

Now let's combine these extensions:

*   Column 1: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1) are 8.
*   Column 3: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,3) are 8.
*   Column 7: (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7) are 8.
*   Row 8: (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7) are 8.

Let's check the proposed outputs:

**Proposed Output A:**
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]  <- (1,1)
 [0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0]  <- (2,1) from (1,1), (2,3)
 [0 8 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0]  <- (3,1) from (1,1), (3,3) from (2,3), (3,7)
 [0 8 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0]  <- (4,1) from (1,1), (4,3) from (2,3), (4,7) from (3,7)
 [0 8 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0]  <- (5,1) from (1,1) and original, (5,3) from (2,3), (5,7) from (3,7)
 [0 8 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0]  <- (6,1) from (5,1), (6,3) from (2,3), (6,7) from (3,7)
 [0 8 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0]  <- (7,1) from (5,1), (7,3) from (2,3), (7,7) from (3,7)
 [0 8 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0]  <- (8,1) from (5,1), (8,3) from (2,3), (8,4) original, (8,5),(8,6) from (8,4), (8,7) original
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

This matches the derived extensions.

**Proposed Output B:**
[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0]  <- (3,3) is 0, but should be 8 from (2,3)
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0]  <- (4,3) is 0, but should be 8 from (2,3)
 [0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0]  <- (5,3) is 0, but should be 8 from (2,3)
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0]  <- (6,1) is 0, but should be 8 from (5,1); (6,3) is 0, but should be 8 from (2,3)
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0]  <- (7,1) is 0, but should be 8 from (5,1); (7,3) is 0, but should be 8 from (2,3)
 [0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0]  <- (8,1) is 0, but should be 8 from (5,1); (8,3) is 0, but should be 8 from (2,3)
 [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

Output B is incorrect because it does not fully extend the '8's downwards in column 3 and column 1. For example, Input[2,3]=8 should extend down to (8,3), but in Output B, (3,3) is 0. Similarly, Input[5,1]=8 should extend down to (8,1), but in Output B, (6,1) is 0.
