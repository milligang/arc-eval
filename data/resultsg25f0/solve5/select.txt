B is correct.

The transformation rule is to repeat the input grid three times, stacking them vertically. For each repetition, the input grid is mirrored horizontally and then vertically. The first repetition is the input grid mirrored horizontally. The second repetition is the input grid mirrored vertically. The third repetition is the input grid mirrored both horizontally and vertically.

Let's apply this to the last input:
Input:
[[3 3]
 [3 0]
 [3 3]]

1. **Horizontal Mirror:**
   [[3 3]
    [0 3]
    [3 3]]

2. **Vertical Mirror:**
   [[3 3]
    [3 0]
    [3 3]]

3. **Horizontal and Vertical Mirror:**
   [[3 3]
    [0 3]
    [3 3]]

Now, stack these three 3x2 grids vertically, and then for each 3x2 grid, duplicate the columns to make it 3x4.

Original Input:
[[3 3]
 [3 0]
 [3 3]]

First repetition (horizontal mirror):
[[3 3]
 [0 3]
 [3 3]]

Second repetition (vertical mirror):
[[3 3]
 [3 0]
 [3 3]]

Third repetition (horizontal and vertical mirror):
[[3 3]
 [0 3]
 [3 3]]

This interpretation of the mirroring is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the mirroring based on the examples.

Looking at the first example:
Input:
[[0 8]
 [0 0]
 [0 8]]

Output:
[[8 0 0 8]  <- Row 0 of input mirrored horizontally and duplicated
 [0 0 0 0]  <- Row 1 of input duplicated
 [8 0 0 8]  <- Row 2 of input mirrored horizontally and duplicated
 [8 0 0 8]  <- Row 0 of input mirrored horizontally and duplicated
 [0 0 0 0]  <- Row 1 of input duplicated
 [8 0 0 8]  <- Row 2 of input mirrored horizontally and duplicated
 [8 0 0 8]  <- Row 0 of input mirrored horizontally and duplicated
 [0 0 0 0]  <- Row 1 of input duplicated
 [8 0 0 8]] <- Row 2 of input mirrored horizontally and duplicated

It seems the transformation is as follows:
1. For each row in the input grid, create a new row by mirroring the input row horizontally and concatenating it with itself. For example, if an input row is `[a b]`, the output row becomes `[b a a b]`.
2. Repeat this transformed 3-row block three times vertically.

Let's re-apply this rule to the last input:
Input:
[[3 3]
 [3 0]
 [3 3]]

Row 0: `[3 3]` -> mirrored `[3 3]`. Concatenated: `[3 3 3 3]`
Row 1: `[3 0]` -> mirrored `[0 3]`. Concatenated: `[0 3 3 0]`
Row 2: `[3 3]` -> mirrored `[3 3]`. Concatenated: `[3 3 3 3]`

So, the transformed 3-row block is:
[[3 3 3 3]
 [0 3 3 0]
 [3 3 3 3]]

Now, repeat this block three times vertically:
[[3 3 3 3]
 [0 3 3 0]
 [3 3 3 3]
 [3 3 3 3]
 [0 3 3 0]
 [3 3 3 3]
 [3 3 3 3]
 [0 3 3 0]
 [3 3 3 3]]

This matches grid B.
